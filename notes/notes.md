using https://github.com/davidstutz/hierarchical-graph-based-video-segmentation to generate segmented regions from a video, \
that is segmented based on both optical flow (motion) and visual similarity (?) \
The original code runs. I can visualize the segmentations. \
When I run the segmentation on my videos and OF, the colors of the segmentation look different. \
The max values of the segmented image pixels are different. why is this ? \

replace the \
hierarchical-graph-based-video-segmentation/segment_cli/main.cpp \
with this main.cpp \

what does it do? \
in the original code, input-gt cmdline argument must be provided. If not there will be an error. \
I have modified this to handle missing input-gt argument, which we do not have.
